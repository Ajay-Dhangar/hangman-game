# Hangman Game

This is a simple hangman game that I created using JavaScipt. The game is played by guessing the letters of a word. The player has 6 chances to guess the word. If the player guesses the word correctly, they win the game. If the player runs out of chances, they lose the game.

## How to Play

1. When the game starts, the player will see a word with dashes representing the letters of the word.
2. The player can guess a letter by pressing a key on the buttons of web page.
3. If the letter is in the word, the letter will be displayed in the correct position of the word.
4. If the letter is not in the word, the letter will be not displayed in the word and the player will lose a chance.
5. The player can see the letters that they have guessed correctly and incorrectly.
6. The player can see the number of chances remaining.
7. If the player guesses the word correctly, they win the game.
8. If the player runs out of chances, they lose the game.
9. The player can play the game again by pressing the `Play Again` button.
